The fire used to burn, all the words used to hurt
But you're not like us, you are different
I couldn't see that that was a compliment
'Cause the last thing I want now is to be you
And the flames don't feel as hot as they use to
Burn, burn, burn
They used to yell
You thought I was coal
My friend, I'm gold
Can't you tell?
Burn, burn, burn
They used to yell
You thought I was coal
My friend, I'm gold
Can't you tell?
'Cause I'm not weak, I'm not broken I am bold
And the fire you put me through turned me into gold
I'm not done, I'm no loser
Watch me take on my bright future
Tonight I'm no bronze I'm no silver
You'll be thinking, damn I knew her
But you didn't
Don't get it twisted
Out of the ashes you buried me in
I, I am golden
I, I am golden
You tried so hard to break me down
Like a fire-breathing dragon, but I guess I took your crown
You pushed for me to change for you
But I'm so glad that I stayed true to who I am
Burn, burn, burn
They used to yell
You thought I was coal
My friend, I'm gold
Can't you tell?
Burn, burn, burn
They used to yell
You thought I was coal
My friend, I'm gold
Can't you tell?
'Cause I'm not weak, I'm not broken, I am bold
And the fire you put me through turned me into gold
I'm not done, I'm no loser
Watch me take on my bright future
Tonight I'm no bronze I'm no silver
You'll be thinking, damn I knew her
But you didn't
Don't get it twisted
Out of the ashes you buried me in
I, I am golden
I, I am golden
The fire that you tried to burn me with, it made me who I am
All the things that you said I couldn't do
Guess what, yes I can
The fire that you tried to burn me with, it made me who I am
All the things that you said I couldn't do
Guess what, Yes I can
'Cause I'm not weak, I'm not broken I am bold
And the fire you put me through turned me into gold
I'm not done, I'm no loser
Watch me take on my bright future
Tonight I'm no bronze I'm no silver
You'll be thinking damn I knew her
But you didn't
Don't get it twisted
Out of the ashes you buried me in
I, I am golden
I, I am golden, golden, gold
I, I am golden, golden, golden
